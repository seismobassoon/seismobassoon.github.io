      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was born in Hyogo, one Friday, November 26th, 1982 and I experienced the Kobe earthquake when I was 12 years old.
However, instead of making me decide to become a seismologist, I just learned that the earthquake prediction is impossible
and that the media and the government had been emphasising the potential danger of only the &amp;ldquo;big one&amp;rdquo; in Tokyo region but not elsewhere,
while it is natural to have catastrophic earthquakes whenever and wherever in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
