06/2020-12/2020, M2, École nationale supérieure de techniques avancées (ENSTA Paris).

During the covid, he was revisiting the high-order Born series for spherical harmonics to explore the possibility of extending the DSM1D software for a 3D globe model. 
Diving into the (nasty) mathematics and my (spaghetti) code, he was able to show properly the limitations of the methodology, which is now one of my motivations to reform flexOPT.jl.
He is now a PhD student in GFZ Potsdam.
