## Geodynamics and seismology: direct and inverse problems

I am a seismologist specialising in seismic imaging of the Earth’s structure and that of terrestrial bodies, and I develop theories and numerical methods to model and invert (geo)physical data, including seismograms and neutrino oscillograms.

Constraining the history of the Earth's and planetary interiors from small data that humans can acquire as of today is a crazy dream. It requires going back and forth from theory to data and quantitative dialogues amongst various domains in science. In order to promote such scientific conversations not only among scientists but with the public at the same time, I initiated an interdisciplinary, intergenerational, biennial hackathon, **CLEEDI**, with my friends, over the course of a week in the heart of Ariège in Pyrenees.

## PhiloGaïa Orchestra: composition of classical music out of geophysics

I am a bassoonist and composer. I compose classical music, inspired by images and videos in geophysics, played in interaction with the data on behalf of the PhiloGaïa Orchestra project. The artistic representarion of science does not necessarily need educational explications.
