# 地球ダイナミクスと地震学における順問題と逆問題

I am a seismologist specialising in seismic imaging of the Earth’s structure and that of terrestrial bodies, and I develop theories and numerical methods to model and invert (geo)physical data, including seismograms and neutrino oscillograms.

Among my research themes, I am particularly interested in the dynamics of mantle plumes and their connections with the LLVPs (Large Low Velocity Provinces) at the base of the Earth’s mantle. I also work on developing new approaches to constrain the nature of the deep mantle, integrating innovative observables such as neutrinos.

Throughout these projects, I have established numerous collaborations at both national and international levels. I also initiated an interdisciplinary, intergenerational, biennial workshop, CLEEDI, designed to foster genuine dialogue among geoscientists from different disciplines over the course of a week in the heart of Ariège.

Geomusic: composition of classical music out of geophysics

I am a bassoonist and composer. I compose classical music, inspired by images and videos in geophysics, played in interaction with the data on behalf of the PhiloGaïa Orchestra project. The artistic representarion of science does not necessarily need educational explications.

I wish to continue along this path in order to affirm my identity as a geo-composer, by exploring musical creation based on geophysical data.
